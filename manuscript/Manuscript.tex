\begin{abstract}
With the housing market fluctuating every year, many real estate owners and businesses face a problem with gaining an accurate representation of the future of the housing market. Lots of people do not know much about the market, so they will go to real estate owners or businesses to learn more about the market. And then see what the market is at and if it is the right time to buy a house. If real estate owners and businesses are able to gain more accuracy in predicting the housing market, they will be able to help more people and possibly gain more business. Not only can this benefit the consumers, the builders are able to move with the market and have a better understanding of it. This paper aims to construct a robust linear regression model by using machine learning techniques to predict housing costs accurately. By leveraging natural language processing, the linear regression model analyzes home property descriptions and extracts vital insights that significantly contribute to precise pricing predictions. This paper ends with an explanation of the limitations of this study and potential future works that can be done.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

% Who collected the data (source)?
% How was the data collected? Sampling frame? Sampling approach?
% What period or range does the data cover?
% Why does the data help answer the research question?
% What exploratory analyses are done (descriptives, visualization, etc.)?

The data that will be used for this study was sourced from \href{https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/housing-price-prediction-linear-regression/input}{Kaggle}. It is a data set that contains \(n = 545\) observations (different house samples) of thirteen variables, seven of which are categorical variables and six are numerical variables. The data set contains features and corresponding labels for training and testing a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model to predict the house cost.
The data was explored and visualized using the pandas library in Python. For the columns that were strings, they have been transformed into an integer data type so that they can be read in the model. More specifically, the 'furnishingstatus' column was broken down into three different columns. One for furnished, one for semi-furnished, and lastly one for unfurnished. 

\begin{table}
\caption{Data Description}
  \label{tab:rv}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
  \toprule
Variable & Data Type & Instance & Purpose \\
  \midrule
price & Int & 13300000 & \(Y\) \\ 
area & Int & 7420 & \(X_{n}\) \\ 
bedrooms & Int & 4 & \(X_{n}\) \\ 
bathrooms & Int & 2 & \(X_{n}\) \\ 
stories & Int & 3 & \(X_{n}\) \\ 
mainroad & Str & yes, no & \(X_{n}\) \\
guestroom & Str & yes, no & \(X_{n}\) \\
basement & Str & yes, no & \(X_{n}\) \\
hotwaterheating & Str & yes, no & \(X_{n}\) \\
airconditioning & Str & yes, no & \(X_{n}\) \\
parking & Int & 2 & \(X_{n}\) \\
prefarea & Str & yes, no & \(X_{n}\) \\
furnishingstatus & Str & furnished, semi-furnished, unfurnished & \(X_{n}\) \\
   \bottomrule
\end{tabular}\par

In Table~\ref{tab:rv}, the 'variable' column shows the names of all the variables that are in the dataset. The 'Data Type' column shows the data type of each variable in the dataset. Note that 'Int' means integer and 'Str' means string. The 'Instance' column shows an example of what a data point for that column would look like. The 'Purpose' column shows the importance of each variable to the machine learning step.

    \label{fig:categorical_plots}
In figure~\ref{fig:categorical_plots}, the plots show the distributions for all the categorical variables. Most of the houses in this data set are located near a main road. Only one-fifth of the houses have a room for guests. For the basement category, two-fifths of them have one. Almost none of the houses have hot water heating. There is air conditioning in about two-fifths of the data. About one-fifth of the houses are located in a preferred area. And lastly, the house can come either furnished, semi-furnished, or unfurnished. Most of the house came semi-furnished, next being unfurnished and then fully furnished.

    \label{fig:numberical_plots}
In figure~\ref{fig:numberical_plots}, four different plots are shown to display the distribution of the numerical variables in the data. The average number of bedrooms in these homes is three, with two being the second most. For the number of bathrooms, the majority of homes have one. About half of the homes in the data are one-story homes while about the other half are two stories. For parking, most of them have no parking spots. A few of them have one or two parking spots.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:meth}

% Establish notation.
% What are the observed data?
% What are the models?
% What are the parameters to be estimated?
% How are the point estimators obtained?
% How are the uncertainty (standard errors) of the point estimators assessed?
% How are the variances of the point estimators estimated?
% How are the null distribution of the testing statistics established?
% Clearly state the assumptions and claims of theoretical results.
The data was first processed by making all the variables in the data able to be read by the model. The first variable that was altered was the status of the house being furnished. It was converted into dummy variables. A one in the dummy variable would mean that the house was in that current status and a zero would mean that it was not in that status. After that, the next step was to convert the yes and no entries to 1's and 0's. This was done to the variables mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, and prefarea. Before splitting the data set into train and test groups, the variables were scaled because the values for price and the area of the house was significantly much larger than the other values in the data set. Scaling is needed here because we want the values from each variable to contribute equally to the model and avoid the overpowering features with larger values. 




\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Multi}
  Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1} + \beta_{2}X_{2} + ... + \beta_{n}X_{n} + \epsilon
\end{equation}

Equation~\ref{eq:Multi} is the Multiple Linear Regression model being used. \(Y\) is the dependent variable, also known as the value that is being predicted. In this case, it would be the cost of a house. \(X_{n}\) is the independent variable, which is the characteristics of the house that are used to predict the house cost. \(\beta_{n}\) is the average amount by which the dependent variable increases and decreases depending on when the independent variable increases one standard deviation. When all the other independent variables are held constant. \(\beta_{0}\) represents the value of the dependent variable when all the independent variables are equal to zero. \(\epsilon\) is the error term which represents the margin of error within the linear regression model. \cite{uyanik2013}


\section{Simulation}
\label{sec:sim}

% Aims
% Data generating mechanism
% Estimand/target of analysis

% Performance measures

\begin{align}
\label{eq:R2}
\begin{split}
    R^2 &= 1 - \frac{\text{sum squared regression (SSR)}}{\text{total sum of squares (SST)}}, \\
    &= 1-\frac{\sum(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2 }{\sum(y_i - \Bar{y})^2} 
\end{split}
\end{align}

Equation~\ref{eq:R2} is the formula for R-squared. R-squared is a measure of the goodness of fit of a model. The sum squared regression is the sum of the residuals squared and the total sum of squares is the sum of the distance the data is away from the mean all squared. It is a percentage that takes the values between 0 and 1. If the percentage is 1, then the variation in the \(y\) values is accounted for by the \(x\) values. If the percentage is 0, then none of the variations of the \(y\) values is accounted for by the \(x\) values. \cite{kasuya2018}

\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:regression_plot} shows a linear regression plot with the predicted house price against the actual house price. Based on this plot that was created, it looks like the model was somewhat accuracy in predicting the prices. 



\section{Application}
\label{sec:app}

% Report the statistical analyses in tables/figures.
% When summarizing from tables/figures, paint the big picture, rather than reiterating all of the little details.
% Discussions to link the analyses 

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:disc}

% A summary, again, of the contributions of the research.
% The research question posed as the `need’ of the introduction must be answered here (Zeiger 2000).
% Limitations of the current study
One limitation of this current study is that this data set is very small and has very limited variables. The next step for this study is to gain access to a data set from the actual house market and produce a model with it. Another factor that can limit this study is that nowadays, there are infinite numbers of factors that can affect the cost of a house. So creating a model to include all these new factors is practically impossible. 
\\
\smallskip


% Future directions.
In the last decade, there have been three recessions in the United States. Being able to create a stronger model that can precisely predict the market can be more beneficial than just looking at house prices. If the model can see the fluctuation in the market, then the model can also help predict when the next recession is going to hit.
